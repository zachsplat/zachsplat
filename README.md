### zachary alexander

backend engineer. mostly OCaml and C++ these days, some Go and Python when it makes sense.

interested in distributed systems, storage engines, networking internals, and keeping things simple when everyone else wants to make them complicated.

day to day I work with Linux, think about how data moves through systems, and try to write code that doesn't make me mass the next time I read it.

#### stuff here

most of what's public is small tools or experiments:

- [ocaml-kv](https://github.com/zachsplat/ocaml-kv) - embedded kv store, TCP interface. nothing fancy but it works
- [raft-ocaml](https://github.com/zachsplat/raft-ocaml) - raft consensus, mostly complete. leader election + log replication
- [lsm-engine](https://github.com/zachsplat/lsm-engine) - LSM tree storage engine in C++
- [pcap-tool](https://github.com/zachsplat/pcap-tool) - packet capture parser, wrote it to debug a weird networking issue at work
- [dns-resolver](https://github.com/zachsplat/dns-resolver) - recursive DNS resolver in Go
- [tcp-proxy](https://github.com/zachsplat/tcp-proxy) - reverse proxy, connection pooling, the usual
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/zachsplat/dotfiles) - neovim + tmux + zsh, nothing special

some older projects from school/side stuff are still floating around, I'll clean those up eventually.
